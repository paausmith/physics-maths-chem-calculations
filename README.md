# physics-maths-chem-calculations
Date of the project: April 2014 <br>
<br>
This is a simple project that I created during a High School's course on Visual Basic.<br>
<br>
The programme's aim is to help with some basic physics-, maths- and chemistry-related calculations. It allows to make simple calculations such as the Pythagorean theorem, resistors in series and parallel cirucits, calculate density and velocities. The code is ready for exporting as a Microsoft application. <br>
<br>
The code is written in Visual Basic 6.0. It has just a few comments,  it has been a while since I last looked at the code, it probably needs some updates that I will do at some point. There is a folder for the code wihtin the repository. The code is divided into a main simple code, that links to six Form files which have their own code. <br> 
<br>
The repository includes some screenshots as a preview.
